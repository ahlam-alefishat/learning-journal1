## The process of building WEB pages
* First of all: Who is the Site For?
,every website should be designed for the
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is , what are the  goals and aims from this website?

* Second :Why People Visit YOUR Website?
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
1: The first attempts to discover
the underlying motivations for
why visitors come to the site.
2: The second examines the
specific goals of the visitors.


* Third :Site Maps
Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.
The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.

* Fourth : Getting your message
across using design, the primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

* Fifth:grouping and
Similarity
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend.
