# Choosing a Text Editor
I'm writting this to tell how important is to be 

### what is a text editor?
It is a kind of software that you might download on your device or you can acess it online through your web browser which allows you to  write and manage your text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

#### There are some features you have to take into consideration when you want to choose which text editor is appropriate for you such as:
 1. code completion : saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing,such as the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the
closing of quotation marks when you open them.
 
 
 2. syntax highlighting: is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text .
 Attributes are a different color than elements, This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.
 
 
 
 
 3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue): themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well.
it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue, since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time.
 
 

 
 4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them: A text editor that has a great selection
of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality
as you need it.
