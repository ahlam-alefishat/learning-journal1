# Choosing a Text Editor
I'm writting this to tell how it is  important to be for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.

### what is a text editor?
It is a kind of software that you might download on your device or you can acess it online through your web browser which allows you to  write and manage your text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

#### There are some features you have to take into consideration when you want to choose which text editor is appropriate for you such as:
 1. **code completion** : saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing,such as the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the
closing of quotation marks when you open them.
 
 
 2. **syntax highlighting**: is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text .
 Attributes are a different color than elements, This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.
 
 
 
 
 3. **A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)**: themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well.
it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue, since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time.
 
 

 
 4. **The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them**: A text editor that has a great selection
of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality
as you need it. because as you become more familiar with coding, you may want to add more
features to your text editor .


####Every computer will come with its own text editor which you can use to build your web pages . On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”

 ####Or insted of using the computer text editor you might install a text editor
 
 Examples for a third party options text editors:
1. Notepad++.
2. TextWrangler / BB edit.
3. Visual Studio Code.
4. Atom.
5. Brackets.
6. Sublime Text.


###The Difference Between Text
Editors and IDEs:
## *Text editor* :text editor edits text,it also manages text, and manages files
## *An IDE* :(Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
